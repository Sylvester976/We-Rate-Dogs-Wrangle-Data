# We-Rate-Dogs-Wrangling-Data

My second ALX Udacity project

We start off by gathering data from Twitter Api tweepy.
Go to twitter for developer website
Sign in/up with existing twitter account or create one
Create your App and acquire the required tokens/secret keys
I recommend to try to get Elevated or Academic Research Packages for sucess in the data gathering stage

Asses the dataframes gathered and identify their quality and tidiness issues. Make your observation to prepare the data for cleaning.

Clean based on your Assesment.

Analyse atleast 3 Insights and have atleast 1 visualization.

Create a report documenting the data wrangling process(300-600 words)
