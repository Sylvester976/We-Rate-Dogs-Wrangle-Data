# We-Rate-Dogs-Wrangling-Data
My second ALX Udacity project 

We start off by gathering data from Twitter Api tweepy.
Go to twitter for developer website
Sign in/up with existing twitter account or create one
Create your App and acquire the required tokens/secret keys
I recommend to try to get Elevated or Academic Research Packages for sucess in the data gathering stage
